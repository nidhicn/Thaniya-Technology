                    computations or how to govern flow of commands between devices. Programming language differ from most other form of human 
                    expression in that they require greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with 
                    other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be 
                    understood.
